The model applied in the present run is  Balbase4 (BB4).

The following addons are applied:
 - *** Addon bypass not implemented for addon BB4
 - Addon heattrans

The following options (not related to addons) have the following option values:
 - Option 'HYRSBB123'      for handling of hydro with storage when using BB3 set at: none
 - Option 'inputdatatxt'   for printing an overview of the inputdata to file inputout.out set at:
 - Option 'printfiles'     for printing various simulation results to folder output set at:
 - Option 'savepointvalue' for saving a GDX file that contains the information on the current solution point set at: 0.  See balopt.opt for more information
 - Option 'bb4weighty'     for BB4 set at: shareYYY

This addon overview is under construction and therefore incomplete.

Some Balmorel errors were detected in the input data before simulation.
See the file errors.out for details about the error.

Since BB4 is presently in developments phase, not all addons are reimplemented for this, and those that are may be only preliminary, so be careful.

Solver status of the BALBASE4 model

   3, at most, models to be solved.
See details of input data in output\inputout\inputout.out (if associated option is set), and in particular for BB4 see output\inputout\BB4overview.out.
