   The above check on reasonable consistency between the FLHs calculated from the input variation profile over (SSS,TTT) (the whole year) and over (S,T) (the time segments selected):
   For the calculation and check to make sense is must be assumed that DE_VAR_T and DH_VAR_T are given for a whole year, i.e., CARD(SSS)*CARD(TTT) = 8736 ('whole' year).
   It is also assumed that the weights of the segments is in such full-year case the same for all (SSS,TTT), i.e., the corresponding IHOURSINST(SSS,TTT) are the same for all time segments.
   The above check on Full Load Hours FLH was made with a tolerance on the quotient of 0.100.
   CARD(S)*CARD(T) is    6, if this number is much smaller than 8736 this may be the explanation, e.g. if the S and T selected do not contain DE_VAR_T or DH_VAR_T values that are representative for the whole year.

   The above check on reasonable consistency between the FLHs calculated from the input variation profile over (SSS,TTT) (the whole year) and over (S,T) (the time segments selected):
   For the calculation and check to make sense is must be assumed that DE_VAR_T and DH_VAR_T are given for a whole year, i.e., CARD(SSS)*CARD(TTT) = 8736 ('whole' year).
   It is also assumed that the weights of the segments is in such full-year case the same for all (SSS,TTT), i.e., the corresponding IHOURSINST(SSS,TTT) are the same for all time segments.
   The above check on Full Load Hours FLH was made with a tolerance on the quotient of 0.100.
   CARD(S)*CARD(T) is    6, if this number is much smaller than 8736 this may be the explanation, e.g. if the S and T selected do not contain DE_VAR_T or DH_VAR_T values that are representative for the whole year.

   The above check on Full Load Hours FLH was made with a tolerance on the quotient of 0.100
   CARD(S)*CARD(T) is    6, if this number is much smaller than 8736 this may be the explanation, e.g. if the S and T selected do not contain VAR_T values that are representative for the whole year.
